# Mandatory git policy

Every repository must include a project specific `.gitignore` based on the organization standard in `gitignore_standard.txt`. Repository owners may add additional project requirements, but must not remove the security, secret, temporary, IDE, AI tooling, or generated file exclusions. Only project relevant source code should be committed.

## What this skill checks

1. A `.gitignore` exists at the repository root.
2. It contains every required category from the standard. The categories are:
   - OS generated files
   - Logs
   - Environment and secrets (with `.env.example` kept via a negation)
   - IDE and editor files
   - Node and React build output and dependencies
   - Python caches and virtual environments
   - Frappe and ERPNext generated paths (when the project uses them)
   - Docker data and image archives
   - Temporary files
   - Build artifacts
   - AI tooling and agent generated files
   - Testing output
   - Local development files
   - Miscellaneous backup files
3. No secret bearing file is tracked by git. When git is available, the scanner runs the equivalent of `git ls-files` and flags any tracked file matching secret patterns such as `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `secrets.json`, `credentials.json`, or `service-account.json`. A tracked `.env.example` is allowed.

## How this skill fixes gaps

- If `.gitignore` is missing, create it from `gitignore_standard.txt` plus any stack specific additions the project needs.
- If `.gitignore` exists but lacks required categories, merge the missing lines in without removing anything the project added.
- If a secret bearing file is already tracked, stop tracking it (for example `git rm --cached <file>`), make sure the pattern is in `.gitignore`, and advise the user to rotate the exposed secret, since removing it from the working tree does not remove it from history.

The standard `.gitignore` is reconciled on every Phase 2 fix run as part of Rule 3, not only when a git related gap was the reason for the run.
